# dcc MIR migration - current handoff

`mir-text-size-plan.md` is the authoritative migration log. Historical plans
were removed after their completed findings were folded into that log; git
history preserves them.

## Current state

- Branch: `perf/unified-regalloc`
- Batch 2 base: `07b7e71` (Item T86)
- Ordinary-census coverage: **529/2024 functions (26.14%)**
- Stack-check census coverage: **532/2125 functions (25.04%)**
- Dominant fallback: `text-size` through `spilled-scalar-cfg`
- Goal: 100% MIR emitter coverage without correctness or peep/nopeep
  performance regressions

## Batch 2

1. T87: remove superseded planning documents and refresh this handoff.
2. T88: consolidate duplicated dead-store-forwarding success accounting.
3. T89: completed the safety audit and diagnostic census (402 unique
   function/object opportunities across 88 apps).
4. T90-T91: completed safe suffix trimming and the remaining profitability
   sweep; coverage is 531/2024 (26.24%), with seven new MIR functions and no
   focused peep/nopeep regressions.
5. T92: profile the remaining comparator and near-cost candidates; retain
   fallback for mixed/regressing results.
6. T93: add selected-assembly hashes to census snapshots.
7. T94: test and reject EXTRN-neutral size accounting after a peep regression.
8. T95: admit the structurally proven dead-suffix instruction win in
   `tcnstfld.main`; coverage reaches 532/2024.
9. T96: schedule fallback hash changes for runtime validation and establish a
   deterministic stack-check census.
10. T97: add a measured dead-suffix profitability floor after the
    CI-equivalent gate exposed four weak-margin regressions.

Batch 2 now contains eleven evidence-backed items, T87-T97. The next migration
batch should start from a fresh impact-ranked census after this batch is
published.

## Required process

- Identify the exact affected functions before widening any gate.
- Keep semantic and profitability gates separate.
- Validate changed/newly accepted apps in `-Mode full`.
- Compare both ordinary and `-fstack-check` census snapshots.
- Never update performance baselines to hide a regression.
- Before every commit, run:

  ```sh
  pwsh ./scripts/runall.ps1 -Mode full -Extended
  ```

- Validate with the current `davidly/ntvcm` `main` revision used by CI.
- Push published batches to `origin` (`davidly/dcc`), not the fork.
- Leave unrelated `.vscode/settings.json` changes untouched.

## Deferred work

- `cfg-backedge`: separate correctness project; three forced candidates are
  confirmed miscompilations.
- Pointer-parameter eligibility: requires a per-reference-site classifier.
- Same-block address/value CSE: high potential, but higher risk than the
  object/backend-slot work.
