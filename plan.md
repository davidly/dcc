# dcc MIR migration - current handoff

`mir-text-size-plan.md` is the authoritative migration log. Historical plans
were removed after their completed findings were folded into that log; git
history preserves them.

## Current state

- Branch: `perf/unified-regalloc`
- Batch 3 base: `fae8e72` (Item T97)
- Last committed ordinary coverage: **529/2024 functions (26.14%)**
- Current ordinary coverage: **534/2024 functions (26.38%)**
- Current stack-check coverage: **537/2125 functions (25.27%)**
- Dominant fallback: `text-size` through `spilled-scalar-cfg`
- Goal: 100% MIR emitter coverage without correctness or peep/nopeep
  performance regressions

## Batch 2

1. T87: remove superseded planning documents and refresh this handoff.
2. T88: consolidate duplicated dead-store-forwarding success accounting.
3. T89: completed the safety audit and diagnostic census (402 unique
   function/object opportunities across 88 apps).
4. T90-T91: completed safe suffix trimming and the remaining profitability
   sweep; coverage is 531/2024 (26.24%), with seven new MIR functions and no
   focused peep/nopeep regressions.
5. T92: profile the remaining comparator and near-cost candidates; retain
   fallback for mixed/regressing results.
6. T93: add selected-assembly hashes to census snapshots.
7. T94: test and reject EXTRN-neutral size accounting after a peep regression.
8. T95: admit the structurally proven dead-suffix instruction win in
   `tcnstfld.main`; coverage reaches 532/2024.
9. T96: schedule fallback hash changes for runtime validation and establish a
   deterministic stack-check census.
10. T97: add a measured dead-suffix profitability floor after the
    CI-equivalent gate exposed four weak-margin regressions.

Batch 2 contains eleven evidence-backed items, T87-T97.

## Batch 3

1. T98: audit constant absolute-address chains: 143 functions and 1,188
   eligible accesses, including 99 text-size fallbacks.
2. T99: add one shared resolver and direct one-/two-byte absolute loads and
   stores, including safe intermediate-chain removal and HL forwarding.
3. T100: extend the resolver to fixed-stride constant indexes, with a
   four-percent instruction-margin gate after two measured regressions.
4. T101: implement, measure, and fully revert 32-bit absolute accesses after
   every newly admitted function regressed peep speed or linked size.
5. T102: sweep refreshed near misses and admit only
   `tpeepal.global_escape_store` under a slotless two-block structural gate.
6. T103: reproduce five CI-only performance regressions with the exact
   upstream ntvcm revision and add a 6% byte-and-instruction margin for
   member-only absolute addressing.

The exact-source ordinary census is 534/2024 and stack-check census is
537/2125, both +5 with zero removals. The focused and mandatory full+extended
CI-equivalent gates pass with zero checked regressions.

## Required process

- Identify the exact affected functions before widening any gate.
- Keep semantic and profitability gates separate.
- Validate changed/newly accepted apps in `-Mode full`.
- Compare both ordinary and `-fstack-check` census snapshots.
- Never update performance baselines to hide a regression.
- Before every commit, run:

  ```sh
  pwsh ./scripts/runall.ps1 -Mode full -Extended
  ```

- Validate with the current `davidly/ntvcm` `main` revision used by CI.
- Confirm the resolved local `ntvcm` revision matches upstream before treating
  a performance run as the pre-commit gate.
- Push published batches to `origin` (`davidly/dcc`), not the fork.
- Leave unrelated `.vscode/settings.json` changes untouched.

## Deferred work

- `cfg-backedge`: separate correctness project; three forced candidates are
  confirmed miscompilations.
- Pointer-parameter eligibility: requires a per-reference-site classifier.
- Same-block address/value CSE: blocked/deferred by Item T70's negative
  experiment; it lengthened live ranges, increased fixed moves/slots, and lost
  net coverage. Revisit only with a materially different liveness/cost model.
