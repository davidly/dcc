# Compiler source coverage

Run `sh scripts/compiler-coverage.sh` from the repository root to build a
separate Clang-instrumented compiler and exercise it with:

- all main applications in both peephole and no-peephole modes;
- both stack-check and no-stack configurations of the main suite;
- the diagnostics suite;
- the dccpeep fixtures;
- all applicable C89, C99, and C11 extended single-exec tests in both modes;
- the MIR clobber suite, including qualifier and generated differential matrices;
- the MIR lifetime and required-emission suites; and
- instrumented host MIR verifier mutation tests.

The generated text and HTML reports are kept under
`build/compiler-coverage/report/` and are intentionally not committed.

The normal repository-root compiler is not replaced. The workflow routes
target builds and direct clobber assertions through `DCC`, builds the host
verifier with the same Clang instrumentation, and combines both executables'
coverage mappings. `%p-%m` profile names distinguish process IDs and binary
signatures. Each run removes old raw profiles before collecting fresh ones.

## Legacy-excluded AST/MIR report

Use `ast-mir-summary.txt` as the scoped report, with
`ast-mir-sources.txt` recording its exact source-file denominator and
`ast-mir-coverage.json` containing machine-readable regions and branches.
`summary.txt` and `html/index.html` are unfiltered collection artifacts, not
coverage targets.

The scoped report includes:

- AST storage, parsing, metadata, and statement metadata modules:
   `dcc_ast.c`, `dcc_ast_build.c`, `dcc_ast_metadata.c`, and `dcc_ast_stmt_meta.c`;
- MIR lowering, verification, allocation, selection, streams, and production
   emitters, including the active `dcc_mir_machine_*.c` schedules.

It excludes the legacy direct-codegen modules, all mixed `dcc_ast_gen*.c`
modules, and the optional `dcc_mir_schedule.c` / `dcc_mir_target.c` shadow
models. Excluding mixed modules also omits some active AST classifiers; their
coverage must be classified function-by-function before including it. This is
an active-owner **module** report, not a complete production-only function
classification. Diagnostics, defensive checks, and unused helpers within
included modules remain in the denominator. Legacy codegen is not a target
for coverage-driven test additions.

Measured on macOS with Apple Clang 21, on 2026-09-07, using compiler revision
`9ad4775e` plus the coverage-routing and host-test changes documented here:

| Metric | Covered | Total | Coverage |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Functions | 3,885 | 4,210 | 92.28% |
| Lines | 162,690 | 184,817 | 88.03% |
| Branch outcomes | 80,947 | 138,322 | 58.52% |
| Regions | 154,151 | 173,356 | 88.92% |

Selected active module results:

| Module | Lines | Branch outcomes |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `dcc_ast_build.c` | 88.71% | 74.49% |
| `dcc_ast_metadata.c` | 85.14% | 76.57% |
| `dcc_ast_stmt_meta.c` | 74.70% | 63.68% |
| `dcc_mir.c` | 84.72% | 72.58% |
| `dcc_mir_verify.c` | 98.31% | 95.21% |
| `dcc_mir_select.c` | 67.83% | 56.31% |
| `dcc_mir_homed_cfg.c` | 88.07% | 78.15% |
| `dcc_mir_spilled_cfg.c` | 92.34% | 68.74% |

The run passed both main configurations, diagnostics, extended tests, MIR
regressions, and host mutation tests. The main suite passed 481 applications
and skipped 24 in each configuration, with zero checked performance
regressions. Three coverage-guided host cases check unreachable definitions
feeding a reachable PHI, a branch-local argument at a join call, and a valid
late PHI. They increase verifier branch coverage from 93.84% to 95.21% without
changing compiler behavior.

These percentages measure exercised source, not C semantic completeness or
the percentage of bugs removed. Uncovered branches should be inspected for
meaningful supported cases, not executed merely to improve the total.
Prioritize active qualifier/call contracts and selector rejection proofs;
retain the existing separate tests of volatile access counts and widths.

## Historical unfiltered report

The first full run on 2026-08-28 produced:

| Metric | Covered |
| --- | ---: |
| Functions | 88.48% |
| Lines | 83.91% |
| Branches | 56.77% |
| Regions | 84.60% |

All 473 runnable main applications and all 196 applicable extended tests
passed in both optimization modes during this run. The 12 main-suite and 23
extended-suite skips remained the documented target or dialect exclusions.

This historical total includes legacy and shadow paths and uses a different
workload and denominator. Do not compare it directly with the scoped report
above or use it as a pass/fail threshold.
